1. I want to get the average odds using optional chaining. Use Taz's code for reference. Do I need to make separate components?

2. Make a button that does an axios put, sending game_id, commence_time, sport and the team they chose. I believe this will be two separate buttons with only the team being different. to my databse. How do I do that?

I have a function that sends either the home team pick or away team pick based on which button the user clicks. Does this need to be a post method for bets in my backend?

How do I ensure this goes to the bets table?

1. Create a signin page
-- User sees games once logged in

2. Create a register user page
-- Sends new user to database
